# Production Deployment Challenges

## üéØ Purpose
Document known challenges and potential issues for production deployment based on stage environment discoveries and multi-stack architecture complexity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Production Deployment Issues

### 1. Stage Name Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Mixed stage references throughout the codebase
- Current setup uses both `'dev'` and `'stage'` in different configurations
- Production will need consistent `'prod'` stage references

**Impact Areas**:
- S3 bucket names: `tb365-designs-{stage}`, `apitemplate-exports-{stage}`, `templatebuilder365-{stage}`
- Deployment buckets: `tb365-serverless-deployments-{stage}`
- CloudFormation stack names: `tb365-*-{stage}`
- Environment variables and resource naming

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Audit all `${self:provider.stage}` references across all serverless.yml files
- [ ] Ensure consistent stage parameter usage in deployment commands
- [ ] Verify stage-specific resource creation vs. reference

### 2. Multi-Stack Deployment Coordination
**Problem**: Three separate CloudFormation stacks with potential dependencies
- **DynamoDB Stack**: `dynamodb-stack`
- **Image API Stack**: `tb365-image-api-stage`
- **Integration API Stack**: `tb365-integration-api-stage`

**Production Challenges**:
- Deployment order dependency management
- Cross-stack resource imports and exports
- Stack failure rollback coordination
- Resource naming conflicts between environments

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Document exact deployment order requirements
- [ ] Map all cross-stack dependencies and imports
- [ ] Create production deployment script with proper ordering
- [ ] Test stack deletion and recreation procedures

### 3. CloudFormation Configuration Validation
**Problem**: Hidden configuration errors that only surface during deployment
- Invalid `RootResourceId` attribute existed in configs but was ignored
- Serverless Framework version compatibility issues
- AWS service schema changes over time

**Production Risks**:
- Configurations that work in stage may fail in production
- AWS service limits and quotas differences
- Security policy restrictions in production environment

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Validate all CloudFormation outputs against current AWS schemas
- [ ] Test serverless configurations in isolation before full deployment
- [ ] Review all AWS resource configurations for production compliance

### 4. Environment-Specific Resource Requirements
**Problem**: Production environment needs separate resource instances
- **S3 Buckets**: All buckets need `-prod` versions
- **Cognito**: Production user pool vs. stage user pool considerations
- **IAM Roles**: Production-specific security policies and permissions
- **DNS/Domains**: Production-specific endpoint configurations

**Production Setup Requirements**:
- [ ] Create all production S3 buckets with proper naming
- [ ] Configure production Cognito user pool and client
- [ ] Review and harden IAM policies for production
- [ ] Plan production domain and SSL certificate setup

### 5. Data Migration and State Management
**Problem**: Moving from stage to production environment
- **Project Data**: Existing projects in stage S3 buckets
- **User Data**: Authentication and user management
- **Configuration State**: Environment-specific settings

**Migration Considerations**:
- [ ] Plan data migration strategy from stage to production
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures for production
- [ ] User authentication migration or fresh setup
- [ ] Configuration management between environments

## üöÄ Pre-Production Battle Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Audit (Before Production Deployment)
1. **Stage Reference Audit**: Review every `${self:provider.stage}` usage
2. **Resource Dependency Mapping**: Document all cross-stack relationships
3. **Configuration Validation**: Test all serverless configs independently
4. **Security Review**: Harden IAM policies and resource permissions

### Phase 2: Production Environment Setup
1. **Resource Creation**: Create all production-specific resources
2. **Cognito Setup**: Configure production user pool and authentication
3. **Domain Setup**: Configure production domains and SSL certificates
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement production monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Deployment Strategy
1. **Deployment Order**: Execute stacks in proper dependency order
2. **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Documented rollback plans for each stack
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and performance validation

## üìã Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All stage references changed to `prod`
- [ ] Production S3 buckets created
- [ ] Production Cognito configuration ready
- [ ] Production IAM policies reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployment order documented and tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

### Deployment Day
- [ ] Deploy DynamoDB stack first
- [ ] Deploy Image API stack second
- [ ] Deploy Integration API stack third
- [ ] Validate all endpoints and functionality
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Monitor CloudWatch logs and metrics

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security validation completed
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting verified
- [ ] Documentation updated with production specifics

## üîç Lessons Learned from Stage Deployment

### Key Discoveries
1. **Invalid CloudFormation Outputs**: `RootResourceId` attribute doesn't exist for HTTP API Gateway V2
2. **Stage Name Resolution**: Serverless Framework stage parameter resolution can be tricky
3. **Deployment Bucket Dependencies**: Framework requires existing deployment buckets
4. **Multi-Stack Benefits**: Separate stacks provide better isolation and deployment control

### Best Practices Identified
- Always validate CloudFormation outputs against current AWS schemas
- Use consistent stage naming throughout all configurations
- Test serverless configurations in isolation before complex deployments
- Maintain separate deployment buckets per environment
- Document all cross-stack dependencies explicitly

## üìÖ Timeline Estimate

**Conservative Production Deployment Timeline**: 2-3 development sessions
- **Session 1**: Configuration audit and production resource setup
- **Session 2**: Deployment execution and initial testing
- **Session 3**: Performance testing, security validation, and documentation
